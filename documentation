METHODOLOGY:
   The  ML algorithm used for this face detection was K-nearest neighbours.
   Also,prebuilt Haar Cascade Classifier was used to detect the face section


LIBRARIES USED:
    1-Numpy
    2-OpenCV

DATASET:
   The data_set folder contains three numpy files which represent images of three different people
   each numpy file containing 30-31 images


STEP BY STEP GUIDE:
    1-Firstly,created a face data collection program which when runs one time collects face
      data of a single person in the form of .npy file

        The above step includes:
        a-)Creating a face_cascade object using haar cascade classifier.
        b-)Continuoulsly,capturing a screenshot from the webcam and saving every tenth image 
           in the form of numpy array.
        c-)When webcam captures multiple faces,few lines of code are written to save the image
           with the largest area.i.e. face closest to webcam and ignore others.


    2-Secondly,created a program which is able to distinguish between different faces and
      display their names above the rectangular frame.
 
         The above step includes:
         a-)One by one loading images from dataset and assigning them the labels on the basis 
            their file names,since file name of each .npy file is same as what will be displayed
            above the rectangular frame.
        
         b-)Then,capturing the images from webcam again.These images will be used to predict 
            the person to which it belongs to.This uses KNN algorithm with 5 nearest neighbours
            as the default.i.e if no argument is passed by default.
